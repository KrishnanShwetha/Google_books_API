In this volume in the MIT Press Essential Knowledge series, computer scientist John Kelleher offers an accessible and concise but comprehensive introduction to the fundamental technology at the heart of the artificial intelligence revolution. Kelleher explains that deep learning enables data-driven decisions by identifying and extracting patterns from large datasets; its ability to learn from complex data makes deep learning ideally suited to take advantage of the rapid growth in big data and computational power. Kelleher also explains some of the basic concepts in deep learning, presents a history of advances in the field, and discusses the current state of the art. He describes the most important deep learning architectures, including autoencoders, recurrent neural networks, and long short-term networks, as well as such recent developments as Generative Adversarial Networks and capsule networks. He also provides a comprehensive (and comprehensible) introduction to the two fundamental algorithms in deep learning: gradient descent and backpropagation.

The author, a longtime artificial intelligence researcher specializing in natural-language processing, covers feed-forward neural nets, convolutional neural nets, word embeddings, recurrent neural nets, sequence-to-sequence learning, deep reinforcement learning, unsupervised models, and other fundamental concepts and techniques. Students and practitioners learn the basics of deep learning by working through programs in Tensorflow, an open-source machine learning framework. “I find I learn computer science material best by sitting down and writing programs,” the author writes, and the book reflects this approach. Each chapter includes a programming project, exercises, and references for further reading. An early chapter is devoted to Tensorflow and its interface with Python, the widely used programming language.

Sejnowski'],MIT Press,2018-10-23,"How deep learning—from Google Translate to driverless cars to personal cognitive assistants—is changing our lives and transforming every sector of the economy. The deep learning revolution has brought us driverless cars, the greatly improved Google Translate, fluent conversations with Siri and Alexa, and enormous profits from automated trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Deep learning networks can play poker better than professional poker players and defeat a world champion at Go. In this book, Terry Sejnowski explains how deep learning went from being an arcane academic field to a disruptive technology in the information economy. Sejnowski played an important role in the founding of deep learning, as one of a small group of researchers in the 1980s who challenged the prevailing logic-and-symbol based version of AI. The new version of AI Sejnowski and others developed, which became deep learning, is fueled instead by data. Deep networks learn from data in the same way that babies experience the world, starting with fresh eyes and gradually acquiring the skills needed to navigate novel environments. Learning algorithms extract information from raw data; information can be used to create knowledge; knowledge underlies understanding; understanding leads to wisdom. Someday a driverless car will know the road better than you do and drive with more skill; a deep learning network will diagnose your illness; a personal cognitive assistant will augment your puny human brain. It took nature many millions of years to evolve human intelligence; AI is on a trajectory measured in decades. Sejnowski prepares us for a deep learning future.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780262038034'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '026203803X'}]",False,True,352.0,BOOK,['Computers'],3.0,1.0,NOT_MATURE,False,0.3.1.0.preview.1,False,False,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9xZxDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9xZxDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com/books?id=9xZxDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Deep+Learning&hl=&cd=9&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=9xZxDwAAQBAJ&dq=Deep+Learning&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Deep_Learning_Revolution.html?hl=&id=9xZxDwAAQBAJ,US,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,,US,PARTIAL,True,False,ALLOWED,False,,False,,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=9xZxDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api,SAMPLE,False,"Deep learning networks can play poker better than professional poker players and defeat a world champion at Go.

The exponential growth in computational power is slowing at a time when the amount of compute consumed by state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) workloads is rapidly growing. Model size, serving latency, and power constraints are a significant challenge in the deployment of DL models for many applications. Therefore, it is imperative to codesign algorithms, compilers, and hardware to accelerate advances in this field with holistic system-level and algorithm solutions that improve performance, power, and efficiency. Advancing DL systems generally involves three types of engineers: (1) data scientists that utilize and develop DL algorithms in partnership with domain experts, such as medical, economic, or climate scientists; (2) hardware designers that develop specialized hardware to accelerate the components in the DL models; and (3) performance and compiler engineers that optimize software to run more efficiently on a given hardware. Hardware engineers should be aware of the characteristics and components of production and academic models likely to be adopted by industry to guide design decisions impacting future hardware. Data scientists should be aware of deployment platform constraints when designing models. Performance engineers should support optimizations across diverse models, libraries, and hardware targets. The purpose of this book is to provide a solid understanding of (1) the design, training, and applications of DL algorithms in industry; (2) the compiler techniques to map deep learning code to hardware targets; and (3) the critical hardware features that accelerate DL systems. This book aims to facilitate co-innovation for the advancement of DL systems. It is written for engineers working in one or more of these areas who seek to understand the entire system stack in order to better collaborate with engineers working in other parts of the system stack. The book details advancements and adoption of DL models in industry, explains the training and deployment process, describes the essential hardware architectural features needed for today's and future models, and details advances in DL compilers to efficiently execute algorithms across various hardware targets. Unique in this book is the holistic exposition of the entire DL system stack, the emphasis on commercial applications, and the practical techniques to design models and accelerate their performance. The author is fortunate to work with hardware, software, data scientist, and research teams across many high-technology companies with hyperscale data centers. These companies employ many of the examples and methods provided throughout the book.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781681739670'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1681739674'}]",False,True,265.0,BOOK,['Computers'],,,NOT_MATURE,False,0.1.1.0.preview.1,False,False,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OKAFEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OKAFEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com/books?id=OKAFEAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Deep+Learning&hl=&cd=10&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=OKAFEAAAQBAJ&dq=Deep+Learning&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Deep_Learning_Systems.html?hl=&id=OKAFEAAAQBAJ,US,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,,US,PARTIAL,True,False,ALLOWED,False,,True,http://books.google.com/books/download/Deep_Learning_Systems-sample-pdf.acsm?id=OKAFEAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=OKAFEAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api,SAMPLE,False,"This book describes deep learning systems: the algorithms, compilers, and processor components to efficiently train and deploy deep learning models for commercial applications.","Algorithms, Compilers, and Processors for Large-Scale Production"
