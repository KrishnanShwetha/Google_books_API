The goal of data science is to improve decision making through the analysis of data. Today data science determines the ads we see online, the books and movies that are recommended to us online, which emails are filtered into our spam folders, and even how much we pay for health insurance. This volume in the MIT Press Essential Knowledge series offers a concise introduction to the emerging field of data science, explaining its evolution, current uses, data infrastructure issues, and ethical challenges. It has never been easier for organizations to gather, store, and process data. Use of data science is driven by the rise of big data and social media, the development of high-performance computing, and the emergence of such powerful methods for data analysis and modeling as deep learning. Data science encompasses a set of principles, problem definitions, algorithms, and processes for extracting non-obvious and useful patterns from large datasets. It is closely related to the fields of data mining and machine learning, but broader in scope. This book offers a brief history of the field, introduces fundamental data concepts, and describes the stages in a data science project. It considers data infrastructure and the challenges posed by integrating data from multiple sources, introduces the basics of machine learning, and discusses how to link machine learning expertise with real-world problems.

It covers concepts from probability, statistical inference, linear regression, and machine learning. It also helps you develop skills such as R programming, data wrangling, data visualization, predictive algorithm building, file organization with UNIX/Linux shell, version control with Git and GitHub, and reproducible document preparation. This book is a textbook for a first course in data science. No previous knowledge of R is necessary, although some experience with programming may be helpful. The book is divided into six parts: R, data visualization, statistics with R, data wrangling, machine learning, and productivity tools. Each part has several chapters meant to be presented as one lecture. The author uses motivating case studies that realistically mimic a data scientist’s experience. He starts by asking specific questions and answers these through data analysis so concepts are learned as a means to answering the questions. Examples of the case studies included are: US murder rates by state, self-reported student heights, trends in world health and economics, the impact of vaccines on infectious disease rates, the financial crisis of 2007-2008, election forecasting, building a baseball team, image processing of hand-written digits, and movie recommendation systems. The statistical concepts used to answer the case study questions are only briefly introduced, so complementing with a probability and statistics textbook is highly recommended for in-depth understanding of these concepts. If you read and understand the chapters and complete the exercises, you will be prepared to learn the more advanced concepts and skills needed to become an expert.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781000708035'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1000708039'}]",True,True,713,BOOK,['Mathematics'],,,NOT_MATURE,False,1.2.2.0.preview.3,False,False,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xb29DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xb29DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com/books?id=xb29DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&dq=Data+Science&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=xb29DwAAQBAJ&dq=Data+Science&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Introduction_to_Data_Science.html?hl=&id=xb29DwAAQBAJ,US,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,US,PARTIAL,True,False,ALLOWED,True,True,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=xb29DwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api,SAMPLE,False,"This book is a textbook for a first course in data science.

Harvard Business Review recently called data science “The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century.” It’s not just sexy: For millions of managers, analysts, and students who need to solve real business problems, it’s indispensable. Unfortunately, there’s been nothing easy about learning data science–until now. Getting Started with Data Science takes its inspiration from worldwide best-sellers like Freakonomics and Malcolm Gladwell’s Outliers: It teaches through a powerful narrative packed with unforgettable stories. Murtaza Haider offers informative, jargon-free coverage of basic theory and technique, backed with plenty of vivid examples and hands-on practice opportunities. Everything’s software and platform agnostic, so you can learn data science whether you work with R, Stata, SPSS, or SAS. Best of all, Haider teaches a crucial skillset most data science books ignore: how to tell powerful stories using graphics and tables. Every chapter is built around real research challenges, so you’ll always know why you’re doing what you’re doing. You’ll master data science by answering fascinating questions, such as: • Are religious individuals more or less likely to have extramarital affairs? • Do attractive professors get better teaching evaluations? • Does the higher price of cigarettes deter smoking? • What determines housing prices more: lot size or the number of bedrooms? • How do teenagers and older people differ in the way they use social media? • Who is more likely to use online dating services? • Why do some purchase iPhones and others Blackberry devices? • Does the presence of children influence a family’s spending on alcohol? For each problem, you’ll walk through defining your question and the answers you’ll need; exploring how others have approached similar challenges; selecting your data and methods; generating your statistics; organizing your report; and telling your story. Throughout, the focus is squarely on what matters most: transforming data into insights that are clear, accurate, and can be acted upon.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780133991239'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0133991237'}]",True,True,400,BOOK,['Business & Economics'],,,NOT_MATURE,True,1.1.1.0.preview.3,False,False,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=b4YxCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=b4YxCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com/books?id=b4YxCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&dq=Data+Science&hl=&cd=9&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=b4YxCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=b4YxCwAAQBAJ,US,FOR_SALE,True,US,PARTIAL,True,False,ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY,True,True,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=b4YxCwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api,SAMPLE,False,Getting Started with Data Science takes its inspiration from worldwide best-sellers like Freakonomics and Malcolm Gladwell’s Outliers: It teaches through a powerful narrative packed with unforgettable stories.,31.99,USD,18.49,USD,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=b4YxCwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-b4YxCwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,"[{'finskyOfferType': 1, 'listPrice': {'amountInMicros': 31990000, 'currencyCode': 'USD'}, 'retailPrice': {'amountInMicros': 18490000, 'currencyCode': 'USD'}, 'giftable': True}]",http://books.google.com/books/download/Getting_Started_with_Data_Science-sample-epub.acsm?id=b4YxCwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/download/Getting_Started_with_Data_Science-sample-pdf.acsm?id=b4YxCwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api
