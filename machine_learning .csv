Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models. Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms. A website offers supplementary material for both readers and instructors.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780262337373'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0262337371'}]",True,True,800,BOOK,['Computers'],5.0,1.0,NOT_MATURE,True,1.7.2.0.preview.3,False,False,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=omivDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=omivDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com/books?id=omivDQAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Machine+Learning&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=omivDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=omivDQAAQBAJ,US,FOR_SALE,True,49.99,USD,49.99,USD,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=omivDQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-omivDQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,"[{'finskyOfferType': 1, 'listPrice': {'amountInMicros': 49990000, 'currencyCode': 'USD'}, 'retailPrice': {'amountInMicros': 49990000, 'currencyCode': 'USD'}, 'giftable': True}]",US,PARTIAL,True,False,ALLOWED,True,http://books.google.com/books/download/Deep_Learning-sample-epub.acsm?id=omivDQAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api,True,http://books.google.com/books/download/Deep_Learning-sample-pdf.acsm?id=omivDQAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=omivDQAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api,SAMPLE,False,The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep.

Many successful applications of machine learning exist already, including systems that analyze past sales data to predict customer behavior, optimize robot behavior so that a task can be completed using minimum resources, and extract knowledge from bioinformatics data. Introduction to Machine Learning is a comprehensive textbook on the subject, covering a broad array of topics not usually included in introductory machine learning texts. Subjects include supervised learning; Bayesian decision theory; parametric, semi-parametric, and nonparametric methods; multivariate analysis; hidden Markov models; reinforcement learning; kernel machines; graphical models; Bayesian estimation; and statistical testing.Machine learning is rapidly becoming a skill that computer science students must master before graduation. The third edition of Introduction to Machine Learning reflects this shift, with added support for beginners, including selected solutions for exercises and additional example data sets (with code available online). Other substantial changes include discussions of outlier detection; ranking algorithms for perceptrons and support vector machines; matrix decomposition and spectral methods; distance estimation; new kernel algorithms; deep learning in multilayered perceptrons; and the nonparametric approach to Bayesian methods. All learning algorithms are explained so that students can easily move from the equations in the book to a computer program. The book can be used by both advanced undergraduates and graduate students. It will also be of interest to professionals who are concerned with the application of machine learning methods.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780262028189'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0262028182'}]",False,True,640,BOOK,['Computers'],3.0,2.0,NOT_MATURE,False,preview-1.0.0,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NP5bBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NP5bBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com/books?id=NP5bBAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Machine+Learning&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=NP5bBAAAQBAJ&dq=Machine+Learning&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Introduction_to_Machine_Learning.html?hl=&id=NP5bBAAAQBAJ,US,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,,US,PARTIAL,True,False,ALLOWED,False,,False,,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=NP5bBAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api,SAMPLE,False,Introduction -- Supervised learning -- Bayesian decision theory -- Parametric methods -- Multivariate methods -- Dimensionality reduction -- Clustering -- Nonparametric methods -- Decision trees -- Linear discrimination -- Multilayer ...,

Today's Web-enabled deluge of electronic data calls for automated methods of data analysis. Machine learning provides these, developing methods that can automatically detect patterns in data and then use the uncovered patterns to predict future data. This textbook offers a comprehensive and self-contained introduction to the field of machine learning, based on a unified, probabilistic approach. The coverage combines breadth and depth, offering necessary background material on such topics as probability, optimization, and linear algebra as well as discussion of recent developments in the field, including conditional random fields, L1 regularization, and deep learning. The book is written in an informal, accessible style, complete with pseudo-code for the most important algorithms. All topics are copiously illustrated with color images and worked examples drawn from such application domains as biology, text processing, computer vision, and robotics. Rather than providing a cookbook of different heuristic methods, the book stresses a principled model-based approach, often using the language of graphical models to specify models in a concise and intuitive way. Almost all the models described have been implemented in a MATLAB software package—PMTK (probabilistic modeling toolkit)—that is freely available online. The book is suitable for upper-level undergraduates with an introductory-level college math background and beginning graduate students.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780262018029'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0262018020'}]",False,True,1104,BOOK,['Computers'],,,NOT_MATURE,False,1.2.0.0.preview.1,False,False,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NZP6AQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NZP6AQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,en,http://books.google.com/books?id=NZP6AQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Machine+Learning&hl=&cd=8&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=NZP6AQAAQBAJ&dq=Machine+Learning&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Machine_Learning.html?hl=&id=NZP6AQAAQBAJ,US,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,,,,,,,US,PARTIAL,True,False,ALLOWED,False,,False,,http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=NZP6AQAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api,SAMPLE,False,The book is suitable for upper-level undergraduates with an introductory-level college math background and beginning graduate students.,A Probabilistic Perspective
